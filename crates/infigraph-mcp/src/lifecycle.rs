//! Worker/supervisor process lifecycle.
//!
//! The MCP binary runs as a supervisor that spawns itself with `--worker`.
//! If the supervisor dies abnormally (SIGKILL, crash), the worker used to
//! survive re-parented to launchd/init (PPID 1) while still holding the
//! instance lock — blocking every future MCP start until killed by hand.
//!
//! The supervisor passes its PID via `INFIGRAPH_SUPERVISOR_PID`; the worker
//! polls that PID and exits when it disappears. Stdin EOF alone is not
//! enough: the worker inherits the client's pipe (so it outlives a dead
//! supervisor while the client is up), and the `--ui`/`--serve` modes park
//! in infinite sleep loops that never read stdin at all.
