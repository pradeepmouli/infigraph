; C# relationship extraction queries

; Method invocations: obj.Method()
; `this`/`base` are anonymous keyword tokens in this grammar (not a named
; identifier the way Python's `self` is just a regular parameter) — is_named
; is false for them, and tree-sitter's `(_)` wildcard only matches named
; nodes. Without the literal-token alternatives below, every `this.Method()`
; / `base.Method()` call in the entire codebase silently produced zero
; matches for this pattern (verified: not even the file-level fallback fired,
; the whole invocation was dropped) — despite relations.rs already having
; dedicated "self"/"this" receiver-resolution logic downstream that never
; had a chance to run.

; Delegate construction with a method-group argument: new RoutedEventHandler(Foo)
; / new WaitCallback(this.Foo). This isn't an invocation — it's a reference to
; the method as a value — but detect_dead_code's reachability analysis only
; walks CALLS edges, so a method only ever wired up this way (event handlers,
; ThreadPool/Timer callbacks, PropertyChangedCallback) was flagged dead despite
; being reachable at runtime. Capture the bare-identifier/member-access argument
; itself as the call target; unresolvable candidates (a real variable passed to
; a real constructor) are dropped downstream same as any other unresolved
; @call.func, so this doesn't need to distinguish delegate types from ordinary
; constructors at extraction time.
